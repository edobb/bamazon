Customer Interface

The customer interface allows the user to view the current inventory of store items: item IDs, descriptions, price and quantity in stock. The user is then able to purchase one of the existing items by entering the item ID and the desired quantity. If the selected quantity is currently available, the user's order is completed, displaying the total price and updating the bamazon store database. If the desired quantity is not available, the user starts their order over again.
